A year ago, if you had asked up-and-coming American musicians about the pianist Don Shirley, they probably would have said, “Who?” That’s changed. Shirley is a central character in the movie “Green Book,” which is nominated for five Oscars. Based on a true story, the film follows a concert tour that Shirley, who was Jamaican-American, took through the Midwest and the South, in the nineteen-sixties. He hires Tony Vallelonga, an Italian-American bouncer from New York City, to serve as his driver. (The “Green Book” of the title refers to “The Negro Motorist Green Book,” a guidebook for African-American motorists that led to motels, restaurants, and other establishments that would serve them.) Because of several scenes that show Vallelonga stepping in to save Shirley from hostile white authorities, the film has been criticized for being the latest variation on the tired “white savior” trope. But a look beyond the film, at Shirley’s career, shows that he is more resilient and interesting than any Hollywood cliché.
